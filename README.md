## Description

The Space Invaders game is a classic arcade-style shooter built for single-player action. The game features a player-controlled laser cannon at the bottom of the screen, which can move horizontally. The objective is to destroy all the descending rows of aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen.

## How to Play

Move: Use the left and right arrow keys to move the cannon.

Shoot: Press the spacebar to fire a single projectile.

Aliens: Rows of aliens move from side to side and gradually descend towards the player.

Shields: Four stationary shields provide temporary protection from alien projectiles but can be destroyed by repeated hits.

Game Over: The game ends if an alien reaches the bottom of the screen or if the player loses their last life.

Game Mechanics
Scoring: Points are awarded for each alien destroyed, with different types of aliens yielding different scores.

Difficulty: As the number of aliens decreases, the remaining aliens speed up, increasing the game's difficulty.

UFO: A flying saucer occasionally appears at the top of the screen, offering a high-score bonus if shot down.
